MfEncoder
=========
A native, Media Foundation-based WMA audio encoder

Purpose
-------
This is a tutorial that demonstrates how to perform variable bitrate (VBR) audio compression with Media Foundation.  As far as I can tell, it is the only complete and functional example available on the internet that supports VBR... believe it or not.
